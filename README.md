# Senior Frontend Engineer - Coding Challenge - Blue Coding

### by Artur Guimarães

- Have an empty React project with all his day-to-day tools in the latest version. You can use create-react-app and any other tools, (i.e prettier, eslint, State management lib, installed npm tooling, etc).
- Also have Node and NPM, git installed in a terminal or GUI tool.
- Be ready to query APIs, display results, and use clean code with reusable components and patterns.
- We are not gonna deploy to native platforms but we are gonna use browsers.
- We will use UI components to build the app parts.
- Be ready to describe your solution, be empathic, and discuss multiple approaches and criteria.

`npx create-react-app coding-challenge --template typescript`

`npm i prettier` `npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier`

`npm install -D tailwindcss`
`npx tailwindcss init`


Scenario

You are a web developer for the Acme Software company. You are asked to build an advanced prototype of an
application that functions as a Gif browser. As the back-end doesn’t exist, you are asked to use an API that
exist publicly.
Mission

Your mission is to create a single-page web application and connecting to the Giphy API
(https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide).
Requirements

Your project will be manually revised by an engineer according to the following requirements:
• The page should never reload.

• Provide a form to the user so they can perform a search against the database of Ghipy via the API.
• Show the results on the thumbnails in a logical way. A great quantity of results must load in a way that
performance is taken into account. Allow the user to load more results and use pagination. Also,
provide a way for the user to clear the results.
• Create code in a clean, readable way, allowing normal conventions.
• Develop and test using Chrome/Chromium browser. Your work will be revised with that browser.
• If you have any note or instructions about the exercise, please write them on the README.md
